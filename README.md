# How to package a Python project

PyPI is the Python package index. Repositories in PyPI can be installed using `pip`, the Python package manager. To post code to the PyPI repository, take the following steps:

## Create a LICENSE
## Create a README
Make sure it's descriptive, and includes instructions for possible installation. Contributors will appreciate having this easy, accessible introduction to your project, goals, and possible future directions. 

Here's a [great checklist](https://github.com/ddbeck/readme-checklist/blob/main/checklist.md) for READMEs! 
## Create a build script (setup.py)
